# twitter-follower-increasing-bot
This is the code for a Twitter follower increasing bot that uses the follow / unfollow method described by Mario Filho here. (https://forecastegy.com/posts/how-i-used-machine-learning-to-get-20000-real-followers-on-twitter/)

Please be careful while using this code and remember to leave at least 1-2 days between following and unfollowing accounts, otherwise, you will end up getting shadowbanned on Twitter, i.e, you will not be able to follow or unfollow anyone for 3 days.
